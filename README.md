# Hackathon_Code

This is a dynamic Pricing Optimisation system for Team Terra-bytes' submission for the Hyke.ai Hackathon. It is built on existing practices in the industry with some additional key features that set us apart from current dynamic and real-time pricing systems. We have utilized OpenAI's GPT3.5 model with text-davinci-003 architecture. We also aim to stay ahead of the competition with real-time analysis of competitor prices and market trends along with the use of machine learning to predict future demand patterns, allowing you to adjust your pricing strategy accordingly.
