# Hackathon_Code

This is a dynamic Pricing Optimisation system for Team Terra-bytes' submission for the Hyke.ai Hackathon. 



It is built on existing practices in the industry with some additional key features that set us apart from current dynamic and real-time pricing systems. We have utilized OpenAI's GPT3.5 model with text-davinci-003 architecture. We also aim to stay ahead of the competition with real-time analysis of competitor prices and market trends along with the use of machine learning to predict future demand patterns, allowing you to adjust your pricing strategy accordingly. 



This app is also built on or is an extension of the pre-existing application found on this [GitHub page](https://github.com/amitvkulkarni/Data-Apps/tree/main/Price%20Optimization) and [article](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/08/build-a-price-recommender-app-with-python/).
